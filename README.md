# bike-route-map
Mapping curated bike routes in LA - _Nina & Amy_ create a map!  Amy is the cyclist learning tech.  Nina is the techie learning to ride.  We both love maps and created this project as a way for each of us to share our knowledge with the other.  We want this to turn into a useful resource that helps more people ride their bikes in Los Angeles.

## Log
_5/8/17_ - Updated README with more information.  In considering how to load new data and display it on the map, I think we may want to load it directly into Mapbox as a dataset.

_4/15/17_ - Added popups to the route polylines.  Currently it's hardcoded to display the route name straight from the XML.

_4/9/17_ - Added mouseover/mouseout events to gpx.js.  Set default and hover values for weight and opacity.

_4/5/17_ - Found where the default blue polyline color was defined in gpx.js.  Passed in a polyline_options object to make a red line.

_4/3/17_ - Created basic full page web map.  Mapped a sample GPX route from Amy's morning ride.  Need to figure out how to customize route color and how to smooth the line generated by the GPX.
