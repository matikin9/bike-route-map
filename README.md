# bike-route-map
Mapping curated bike routes in LA!!!

## Background
_Nina & Amy_ create a map!

## Log
_4/15/17_ - Added popups to the route polylines.  Currently it's hardcoded to display the route name straight from the XML.

_4/9/17_ - Added mouseover/mouseout events to gpx.js.  Set default and hover values for weight and opacity.

_4/5/17_ - Found where the default blue polyline color was defined in gpx.js.  Passed in a polyline_options object to make a red line.

_4/3/17_ - Created basic full page web map.  Mapped a sample GPX route from Amy's morning ride.  Need to figure out how to customize route color and how to smooth the line generated by the GPX.
